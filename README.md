# Burnout Prediction Among Medical Students

This repository contains 4 experiments focused on predicting **burnout** and **burnout severity** among medical students using a publicly available dataset from **Carrard et al. (2022)**.

## üìÅ Project Overview

The goal of this project was twofold:
1. **Classify** students as experiencing burnout or not (binary classification).
2. **Predict burnout severity** using the continuous **MBI total score** (regression).

Each experiment included model training, evaluation, and error analysis. Feature importance was additionally conducted for top-performing models.

## Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Binary Burnout Classification (Imbalanced Dataset)**
- **Goal**: Classify students into burnout vs. no burnout
- **Dataset**: imbalanced
- **Models**: 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - XGBoost
  - TabNet
- **Notes**:
  - XGBoost was the best-performing model.
  - Feature importance was analyzed using the trained XGBoost model.

### **Experiment 2: Binary Burnout Classification (SMOTE-ENN Oversampling)**
- **Goal**: Improve classification under class imbalance
- **Technique**: Applied SMOTE-ENN during training
- **Models**: Same as Experiment 1


---

### **Experiment 3: Binary Burnout Classification (Borderline-SMOTE Oversampling)**
- **Goal**: Explore an alternative oversampling method
- **Technique**: Borderline-SMOTE
- **Models**: Same as above


---

### **Experiment 4: Predicting Burnout Severity (Regression)**
- **Goal**: Predict continuous **MBI total score**
- **Models**:
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - SVR (Support Vector Regressor)
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - TabNet Regressor
- **Notes**:
  - SVR showed the best performance.
  - Feature importance was conducted on the trained SVR model.
  - Residual analysis and error distribution were evaluated for all models.
